# CSC3101_Capstone

## Description ðŸ“–
This repository contains the full code implementation of the CSC3103 Capstone project 'Enhancing NLP Models for Social Media Sentiment Analysis'  
Note*: Due to size limitations, certain elements of the project are current missing from the repository such as large datasets and models  
For more information on how to retrieve those datasets and train the models, please refer to the 'Enhancing NLP Models for Social Media Sentiment Analysis' report, section
